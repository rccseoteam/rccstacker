This training is designed primarily for beginners or those of you who need a refresher with the Claris FileMaker platform over the course of 30 days. We're going to spend about an hour each day covering topics from the very basics of the Claris FileMaker platform in terms of the tools, the products deployment, security, all those things you need to know about, as you build a custom application. So, keep in mind that towards the beginning of the training, the topics are more basic in nature and as we get towards the end of the training, they're somewhat more advanced. I would say probably intermediate level topics. Now, keep in mind this special part of this training is that, while we're not only talking about the FileMaker platform, we're talking how you can rapidly customize an existing free CRM that you can download today. It's  unlocked so taking that CRM and customizing it to your organization's  particular needs. Now, a couple important links to keep in mind one is that if you need a copy of FM  Starting Point, the free unlocked  CRM visit FM Starting Point.com and press the button. And then our system will shoot you an email with the current links to that CRM. If you're looking for additional FileMaker training, visit FM Training.TV and press the bundles button. And that will allow you to get more of this highly animated and somewhat energetic training material to help you through the learning process with the Claris FileMaker platform. </p><br><p>Lastly, if you have questions about the FileMaker platform or you're looking for some additional help, maybe some one-on-one coaching help feel free to email us at support RCConsulting.Com. Today is another awesome day of FileMaker training. It's  day three of our 30 days to a custom CRM . It's  basically 30 days of coherent semi-coherent. I guess it's my opinion, it's  coherent but some of you are like hey, Richard's  lost his mind, but yeah. No, it's 30 days or maybe a little more FileMaker training and the goal is to take us from the beginning and basics. We've covered two days of very important beginnings and basic stuff.  Today is basically mostly we kind of pivot back and forth between the basics of building FileMaker. But then I change gears and I'll show you something a little different. It's  all the stuff you kind of need to know in parallel. A lot of you here have been doing FileMaker a little bit. So, today will be more interesting for you because we're going to take a step back from the basics of this text field too. Today is the basics about security questions. If you have about security then we're going to talk about servers and the reason is, is that security? The sequence is that people we cover it right here, people don't care about security until they want to share it and even then sometimes they don't care about security. And then they realize everyone on the internet could read them and so then they're like ah right. So, then they want to put the security on it. And so, the way FileMaker server works these days in FileMaker Cloud is that by default they will not let you post a file that is not locked.</p><br><p>So, once again, this is kind of a test question. If you have a brand new blank FileMaker file, which I have somewhere down here, here's a blank one. There's  a blank one we created if I double click this and fire this up into. I went into Claris Pro. Well, that's  fine for now. What is a brand new file that you create notice? It didn't ask me for a dialogue. What are the default credentials? There's  no checkbox that says: don't use security that doesn't when I first got into FileMaker, I said: Oh, they must have a checkbox that says, don't use security and then, after a while, you turn security on. That's  not really true. When you create a brand new FileMaker file? You go file manage security. What you'll see is by default. It creates an admin. It's an account. It's  an account. Once again, I need to zoom in on this on everyone minus the zoom. People can't see my zoom, but this is an admin.These are accounts and it's  set with the admin privilege. Set right here and there's  no password. So, if I zoom back out a little bit and I click on the side over here. It will see it says no password. So, you have an admin, no password. So, in theory, I can actually force it to do this in theory, because it does that you should see if you don't open it up.You should say: Oh, blank file, admin, no password right? So, you put no password, you log in and notice that it does that for us automatically. If I double click over here, it just does it. So, how does it know to do that? Okay, something I haven't talked about yet file options: okay and then what you're going to do is you're going to say when and if you can re see this right here it says when opening the file. What it should say is, It should say when opening a file attempt to do this, it doesn't guarantee it's  going to do it. Is this going to attempt it? So, it's  attempting to open up with admin, no password. </p><br><p>So, when you create a brand new FileMaker file, this is the way it does it. It says the credentials on the other side with admin or password, then over here it says auto login with admin no password. So, it essentially bypasses it right? So, if I change this to something else, like doggy the type doggie in there and I hit okay, okay. It says the provided user account cannot be used to open this file. So, it doesn't work. What could happen is I could have no password in here right. No password here and I could actually say: Okay and then I come back over into security on the file file, manage security. Notice, there's  no keyboard shortcut for that. Too bad and then you go and you come over here and you say change it to doggy. I want it to be admin, doggy right, d-o-g-g-y, very simple. It says a weak password, okay. We say okay and then it says verify that you know your administrative password, admin doggy, okay. So, now it is I close it now when I double click it open it. What's  it going to attempt to do remember? I said that dialogue should attempt to do this. Attempt it if it's  possible, no guarantees, because that would make more sense. Because now it's  going to attempt it, but it's  going to fail when it fails. It throws a dialogue. I attempted adding a new one but it didn't work. It says I don't know if it's Friday right now. My vocabulary has gone to hell already. You got admin, remember. There was no password before now. It's  d-o-g-g-y doggy and we're in. So, understand one when you have a brand new file, that's  what it does when you get a copy of FM  Starting Point from me. We leave that setting intact. So, when you open it, you're not presented with what's  your password.</p><br><p>Once again, it's  a friction point as you're working with people in the FileMaker community. You're working with people in your own business, you're in business for yourself, Scott Kane  . When Scott Kane  runs into people, he generally doesn't want to tell because he's  selling software for roofing businesses and stuff like that. I don't even know if I'm describing it correctly. But he's doing a vertical market application. He doesn't want to go. You don't go to business and say no right? So, you go into the restaurant. You say well, I'd really like that pasta, spaghetti meatball thing, but could I get extra meatballs? No, okay. Could I get it with a different sauce? No, it's  like the soup, Nazi you're gonna drink to eat the soup and you're gonna like it, and we're gonna beat you and throw you out of here right. That was the soup Nazi in New York. If you even twisted and said anything about his soup, he would take your soup. Refund your money and throw your ass out of the business and never let you back in and the soup is. Apparently pretty amazing, but people would always say I need some more salt or something right. So, that is the epitome of super friction. But the guy's stuff was so good. Everyone put up with it and he was also kind of comically ashamed because some poor unsuspecting person would say: Do you have some salt? He would take your soup and refund your money until you get the hell out. It doesn't need salt. You're an imbecile right? And so, you can get away with that in some places but here you can't. So, we wanted less friction. So, no passwords unless you need passwords which is why we're here or they don't care about security until it's  too late. Well, yeah, I mean if your admin, if your password is like, for example over here and I want to share this with everyone.</p><br><p>So, the other day you saw me upload a FileMaker file to the server. We're going to do it again here. For you shortly, what I've done for the moment is, I am going to log on to a FileMaker server, a Claris FileMaker server. And I'm attempting to control that server.This is a server that happens to be on windows on an Amazon virtual server. The interface for this, if you're using Cloud two. Once again, we're always talking about the two really. The two versions of the server are FileMaker, Claris, FileMaker, Server, Mac, Windows or Linux, and that's considered the on-prem software right, the on-prem or on-premises software. And it's  misleading like that's  only Claris corporate people talking that way.They give it that little name right. They call it that. So, I call it that so we can. I can talk to them because they use a different version of English than I do. And so, they say on-prem which means the software that they don't resell as a package and they call theirs cloud implying that. That's the only cloud  and this is not a cloud except this right here is running on the Cloud. It's in my aws data center. I don't know, probably on the West Coast of the United States somewhere. I would guess so. I'm going to go in here. I'm going to put in an admin doggy. Just kidding. It's  got a more evolved password. I'm not going to bother you all that. This is your FileMaker server interface, okay. So, the goal is to get your file here.</p><br><p>Why do we want the file in here? So, we can share it with our team. In order to put it on here we have to put at least a basic password. You have to at least go to that admin password and change it to something. That's  not space that is kind of the minimum. There's  a little bit more to it. We'll cover that briefly, but I just kind of want to show you the goal of where we're trying to go. So, in here's people already here. This is Andy, one of my staff. This is Michael, Michelle. Here we go, right? Seven minutes ago. People are logging in while WJ Warner is here. Welcome WJ from twin cities. I got it memorized. We've been hanging out together. So, long being buddies right. The files that are on the server we have databases. These are the files over here. These are loosely the collection of clients that are connected. If I click on this file right here. Then I saw that I got Andrew's Michelle graver from Montreal, Canada. Welcome a windows user, I'm not sure that is a WJ Warner. Okay, welcome. So, these are pretty much all known. People know commodities, right? If I log in you, I would see that pop up as well. I'm not currently logged onto that file. But this is pretty neat because it shows you the version of FileMaker. They're used right here. Pretty neat. Oh, Windows users need to update. It's  a free update. Go update your stuff. Then over here yeah 19.4.2 and then pretty soon at some point it'll be 19.5.1 right? This is your FileMaker server interface. The FileMaker Cloud interface. If you're buying the service from Claris, where they run the server for you. It'll say Claris Cloud or something like that. I don't think it says FileMaker Claris, FileMaker Cloud, whatever and the interface will be very, very similar, the difference is the backups. For the most part it will be somewhat different. Okay, you schedule your own backups when you want them to run. And there's some other little things you have to do.</p><br><p>It's  not really a server configuration conversation today. But I want to get you folks comfortable with the concepts here. So, what we're going to do is I'm going to minimize this for the moment. Move it out of the way. It's  important. Security is evolving in the FileMaker platform. It's  a lot easier and more reliable to get set up with a single sign on a single sign-on right with. Which is where you use Azure or active directory. Everyone knows the active directory, if you're a windows shop. It's  like the default answer for everything. Microsoft, just use SQL, just use active directory, just use sharepoint right. So, there's  all these default things that they say are active directory. We've done demos on it with Azure using Azure so it's  a cloud-based active directory. We have a number of live streams on it. Where we set that up. It was at least two of them that are in our recordings that we cover in detail. Works Pretty good. In fact, that's  what we use internally at RCC right now is Azure, the only Microsoft product. We really really really won't use Microsoft office, because we're mostly a Mac shop, but that Azure price point is basically free for a company our size. We have 30 people. And all we need is the active directory part of it. Active directory is a peripheral service that Microsoft offers. They offer other virtual servers and things like that. That's  where they want you to pay them, but for us we're using Amazon for that. Which is by far they don't. Have this anti-Mac fundamentally issue Amazon's. The primary goal in life is just to make money and they don't care what color your money is as long as it goes to the banking caches. So, it's  talking about security. You can do security where authentication is basically file-based authentication or it's authentic. </p><br><p>Your authentication is verified with a third-party service. So, you basically tell your FileMaker server. There's  this third-party service. It's  trusted! You go through this process of setting up a couple tokens and API’s. All you have to do is kind of copy and paste the stuff in. And so, the FileMaker server knows how to talk to this third-party service. In our case it was Microsoft Azure. And so, when you log on with Microsoft, Azure or you come to FileMaker families and say oh you're, trying to authenticate. It shoots you off to Microsoft, Azure Azure, authenticates you and then Azure sends back a secret token, telling FileMaker server. That, yes, you in fact are a trusted person and you're allowed in the system. That's  what this is over here. It's a multi-day conversation by itself. We've already covered this. We already have recordings on it. I recommend you watch that if some of you are interested in that today we're talking about file-based security, file-based authentication, it's  the old-school authentication for the quick and dirty get something going.</p><br><p>It's  the way to go for a large organization when you have 30 or 40 people. Suddenly, using some sort of service makes things a lot simpler, but once again this is kind of a basic training course. So, we're going to cover the basics here .The idea is that you're by default. There are some predefined privilege sets.The privileged sets are full access, data, entry-only and read-only. Only you can create your own variation of these by duplicating this x, this credential or duplicating this one and then adding or removing capabilities to it. But full access is basically like super user, slash god mode, not defending anyone, but that's  kind of like you can do anything with the solution, including destroying it right. Data entry only is just that you can add edit delete data data, but you can't do any structural design to the file. And then read only is read only pretty straightforward. Those are what comes by default FileMaker. So, if I go over here to blank over here I open up blank and now blank is looking for admin. I think doggy right is what it's  doing admin d-o-g-g-y. So, then I go file manage security. Then we have two. These are accounts here. So, we have these at. You know we have basic settings here and Claris created this and it was like what are you guys doing right? So, this was unnecessary because you have to explain this to people but you have accounts and you have privilege sets. And then you have extended privileges. So, you have like these three elements right? So, these are accounts. So, if I created Fred, ideally these would be individualized. You could have Fred with no password, right? And Fred is read only and then you could also instead of having Fred, you could have your sales team all use one password.</p><br><p>The problem with that is that really this is kind of old school kind of sloppy. It's  what you do in the near term. When you're trying to throw it together  and you don't have time to create 20 usernames and passwords. You don't have time to hook up an active directory or some other service. You just want something quick and dirty for that group of people and then you're going to share with them sales.The password is sales. Maybe the account name is sales and then they have this password. Which is cryptic or marketing or engineering or whatever you want to do so. Ideally, it's  individualized. In fact, you'll see a push by Claris towards everything being individualized especially if you start to use their services, the Claris cloud service. It has to be individualized.There's no groups like that at the account level. Yeah, yeah, it's individualized because that's how they meter what you're going to buy and sell. The conversation today is about basically at the end of the day eventually at some point later this year, Claris will make some flavor of FileMaker Pro free. We have no details on that. Besides, they like the idea and they're working that way. There's  no details. We have no insight. People ask, can I use runtime with it? Claris has made no announcements other than they said. We like this idea of freemium. I think we want to do this in 2022. That's  what they've told us so far. So, don't ask me beyond that. What does that mean? But there's  a possibility. They could handicap it or limit it in some way, in a way that we haven't thought about. That might aggravate people. So, I don't want to promise anything right like yeah. You can use it on a run time. Yeah, maybe not right. So, the idea is that Claris is going with this model where they don't care. </p><br><p>If one person uses it or just Michael, Scott Kane uses it or just one other Sally Brown just uses it. What they care about is if Michael Scott  builds a solution for project management and then he sells it or Scott  makes a project solution, a vertical Market solution. And he sells it as soon as you do. Don't sell it. But as soon as you have a group of people sharing the file on a FileMaker server, Claris wants to charge for those users going to that server. So, they basically want the individual as you're running the file locally on your desktop over here. Like I'm running it locally on my desktop. They don't care, they don't want to. They don't want your money, they're going to give that away. They want you to use it for free. However, as soon as you get to a point where you're hosting it you're sharing with a team you're deriving value as an organization, you need to get out and write them. A check out brings the money right. But by that time your organization should be deriving value and you should be willing to take money and to pay them right. It should be valuable to you at that point. If it's  not valuable to you, then something has gone wrong along the way. We have this idea of security here then. Once the security is set on the file like we have this blank file right here, we'll go ahead and post this to the server. So, we have Fred, we have admin, which is going to be. I think, doggy, okay, we're very very much with that.</p><br><p>We got Fred with no password. We'll need someone to test that we have sales with no password for now. Okay and they're active now. What's  interesting about this is that you've got an account. You've got a privilege set, which is what they can do inside of FileMaker. If I hit advanced settings here, it brings up a really important thing. We're not going to talk about file access, just shelve that one, it's  not even really. As long as using a single file. The FileMaker solution is not even really relevant. But if you have privilege sets  and you have extended privileges. So, what you could do is you could look at a privilege set over here like full access. I'm going to come over here and look at this, and this is what the privilege set allows me to do. What records can I access? You can customize by a certain calculation. What records they can see on which tables, what layouts they can see, what value lists, what scripts they can kind of access or edit? These are all the checkboxes. This right here is extended privileges. I mentioned this the other day. This is a certification test question. A lot of what I'm talking about here is on the certification test. Extended privileges manage how FileMaker the data in FileMaker is shared outside of the FileMaker account. It should be to the individual, or maybe a group. If you're sharing it with a group, a privilege set is a role it's what they can do right. Extended privileges are what are kind of like a fine detail to the privilege that they're attached to a privilege set. So, as you see right here, there's  a privilege set. These are extended privileges. All these extended privileges have to do with somehow FileMaker being shared out and away off the server or off your local file. </p><br><p>So, can someone if they're on the server can someone access it with Pro? Can someone access it with Go? Can someone access FileMaker that FileMaker solution with WebDirect, which is the web browser rendering of the file right? Can they access it with the data API or with ODBC, or can they do this? That any other thing, and so, all that is listed in here right,and some of these are not are not well labeled. We talk about this in our certification test. All of this is definitely on the certification test. If you care about things like that and so, for example, what'll screw people up absolutely screw them up endlessly is. Do you have full access in your admin? You're like yeah, mad man, I'm full access. I'm awesome! Then you post the file to this server. It's  running on the server the file will say running on the server. In fact, I will just yeah. Let's  just go ahead and go through the sequence of doing this here. I'm going to look at this. I have admin rights here. Once again, everyone follows here. I'm trying to do this and notice that most of the sharing is checked off here, except for this one. But generally, you can't when you have the full access seats in brackets up here and read only and date entry. Only those are brackets over there. You can't edit them. You could duplicate them and change them. You can't edit them. So, what I've got is what I've got, and these are the privilege sets. These are the extended privileges.</p><br><p>Once again, that's that same little list, but you can see them here differently. You can also see these if you click on them. What a privilege to use them. So, really most of these are not being used by anything okay. Which makes them theoretically more secure and I say okay. So, it says, what's the admin password? Once again d-o-g-g-y. So, that's  my blank file. I'm gonna tell my blank file to share the file upload to a host. Upload to a host, see where it says, share here with FileMaker clients that are being removed in FileMaker 20. It goes away. It's  already been told. It's  being deprecated. Some of you are going to cry that you don't want to, don't you want to buy a FileMaker server. You want everything in life for free. I'm sorry. If you're going to complain about this being removed, you should also send emails to Tim Cook, asking for the iPhone to be free too. That would have about the same level of traction with the company. So, uploading to the host means uploading the server. It says hey, when I close the file before I upload it, you go yep, that's  totally cool. I have my trial server that we're playing with. I haven't already put the credentials in here. I've saved the credentials I wrote them down. So, I don't have to type them in front of you and give them to everyone here I sign in and it says. Hey, this file is ready to be uploaded. Are you really really really sure that you want to upload it right and you go yep upload it? So, it's  going to upload it and then it's  going to pop it open automatically and you say done. And now it's  going to attempt to open this file as opposed to this file. This file here and this file here.This is the hosted one. This is the local one. Okay, so, I'm gonna say admin doggy and it let me in interestingly enough. I think it made an in-flight adjustment with that because sometimes that can fail and I will show you why that fails. </p><br><p>I'm going to close this right here.I'm going to double click this one. Now this file knows ding ding ding knows it was uploaded. And so, it says, hey, you upload this but since you're kind of not very bright and even I've done this before. You probably forgot you uploaded it and you probably shouldn't have it probably should say. You probably shouldn't be using the local copy anymore right? Because you uploaded it and you should be using it with your team. If you upload, if you use the local file and then you use a hosted file later, you'll think that the data was deleted when actually you've been using two different databases. Where you should have only one database. So, warning you are potentially stupid. Should be like a little person there with a hole in their head, not very bright, individual warning warning warning warnings right. But, they don't say that because they're very nice company, okay. So, if I say use a hosted version. Then that's how we would do so. So, instead I double clicked on the local file. It warned me and then it bounced me to the hosted one which is kind of a neat thing really as a reminder. Once you post it to the server please remove it off your desktop. Because this happens with customers all the time. They have a local file. They have a hosted file. They use both and they wonder why their data is screwed up. Okay. And really it's  just bad organization. Okay, so, we are on the hosted file notice. It says blank princess parentheses, the name of the server right there, okay. Now, if I go back to my server which is right here I go to databases. Now you can see that blank there. It is right. So, you folks could log on to blank because you could log in. So, If I want to log in somebody, can you log in to that right? It's  blank. It's  admin and doggy all lower case on both of those. </p><br><p>As a reminder, the username is not the case. Sensitive, the password is case sensitive, very important. So, as people log on to this. Some of you will probably be logging on any second that will change. It will refresh and update and then I can see them logged on here. So, the question is there is a restriction of logging on to the file as five people log in as admin? There's no restriction to that at all right. So, there's  the first one right. There someone is called. Is that you Margaret? Yes, your computer is called Richard Carlton. If other people out there run around with computers called Richard Carlton. I have concerns about it. So, yeah my staff tend to forget to change it to their own name. But so, it shows up. It shows that Margaret's  using version 19.4.2 right? So, she's  also logged into admin. Someone else logged me in as admin. Can we do that too? That would be great. In fact, two of you should log in on different computers right? So, it's  either the host is trial or it's  up here. So, for the host right, it says trial dot at RCC.com and that's  one way of getting into it. The other way is with a launcher file. I guess we could dive into that briefly here. Briefly, here we've got time. The launcher file right here is a sample file. So, what I'm going to do is if I double click and open this double click it is just what it's  done. This is a launcher file. That's  programmed to open a copy of Starting Point, or in this case it's  our trial version of the new Starting Point light. That's  on the server and so it's  great. Because you can distribute to your users a launcher file. Logging on to the file. That's  interesting! I just hear myself as five people on I'm hearing myself in my some live stream. It's  a looping loop. I have no idea why that's  there. So, someone changed. You guys changed my link here. That's  awesome! Someone changed my link behind my back. Nice. Better not be any naked people in here. I'm going to be really unhappy about that. </p><br><p>So, what it is is that you post the file up on the server okay. It wasn't me, says David Angel, of course right. And so, you have this launcher file. So, what it does is all this is a tiny little FileMaker file. It doesn't have anything like 295k. Which is kind of on the fat side. It's  pretty small. And all this does is that you program it to open up a file for you. That's  running on the server. So, this is a local copy of the file but this opens the file on the server. So, if it comes over here. If you look over here, it auto opens this file right here which is kind of great right. So, if you come over here, it all opens that file. So, what I'm going to do is what I'm going to take. I'm going to take this launcher file but I'm going to do it. I'm going to go into FileMaker real quick. I'm going to say enable script debugger. So, scripted buggers on it's  kind of how you're going to stop this thing from running wild. So, you're going to double click, the launcher and it fires up and starts running. I'm going to minimize this for now. So, this is the launcher file and the script starts running, but it's  paused because the script debugger is on. I know that it's  a little different for people here. It's  a little bit more advanced. We haven't talked about scripts. These are the little programs that we're going to write. We're going to start off with some very simple ones that are three or four lines. This is a longer one but it does. But if you read it doesn't do that much. These are just notes here saying that Michael Von Kranenberg built this in January of last year. Which is interesting and then we go through here and it says go to a certain layout right. Go to a layout.Go here. Go there. Open a file right, it's  pretty straightforward. But what I want to do I want to stop it real quick. I'm going to come over here and I want to. </p><br><p>For those of you who have a little bit more skill set. I'm just going to jump the corner here but you have two only two layouts in this file. This file layer has the name of the file. It's  going to open okay. So, it's  set for the name of the server right here. The name of the file right here once you've changed that you just close it and you're done and when you double click you could rename this. You could call it. Dave learned super duper doggy style, launching files right. Whatever you want to call it and you double click it and it fires up. Now, if you've already put the password in here. So, I say put admin here automatically and I say save the changes. Then it just pops the file and it's  open on this computer. And then it fires up and I hear myself again which is crazy. So, I'll come over here. So, I've closed it. In fact, I can even quit FileMaker entirely. Okay, you give everyone in your company this launcher. Once they enter that password, that credential wants. It won't bother them anymore. Generally, when I double click it opens. FileMaker opens the launcher, the launcher, bounces them to the actual file on the server done.Okay, Margaret should have given you a blank file on the trial server. It doesn't open a blank file under what credentials. Reuben, under what credentials? I did not have credentials. No, you have to type in admin too. Is it admin and doggy and doggy right? I think that's right. Oh, he, they can't, they can't see blank at all. You can't see it at all. Okay, hang on, that's  what was supposed to happen. But I don't. I was sitting there and I was like okay. I think this kind of malfunctioned. So, I'm going to host. I'm going to go to trial. I see a blank. You get when you go to trial at RCC. You don't get this far. You don't see this at all. Oh, wait! I'm trying to open it with WebDirect okay. That's really good! That's  a really great example of the extended privileges which is where I was trying to go.</p><br><p>So, if I say open right here open blank, it's  going to ask me for my credential, it's  admin. Is it doggy on this one? Yes, doggy. So, we're in the file. When the file is running on the server and you're an administrator. You can make all the changes you want to the file. There's  almost no changes that you have to make locally anymore back in the old days 20.30 years ago. You had to download the FileMaker file locally, make changes and post it back to the server and see how it behaved. Now you can do it while it's all still running on the server. So, I go over here. I go file manage security. Okay, and I'm logged on as admin right now which is interesting. Because if you come over here remember what the advanced settings said over here for privileges. If you get full access that check box was not there.Okay, this check box  and this is I guarantee on your certification test file access via FileMaker network.This is a phrase that goes back to 1993, 92, 93 94, whenever the very, very first FileMaker server came out. And it's  interesting because what this does is this enables you to access it. If I turn this off, you can't you can't get in with a Pro or Go. So, what FileMaker access means is FileMaker Pro or FileMaker Go on the certification test. They're likely to say something. We call them dragons. They're fake things that sound like real access via FileMaker Pro is checked on or off access via iOs is checked on or off that doesn't exist. So, Pro and Go are right here. Remember Go is the iOs application right? That's  like a Pro and then over here is WebDirect. That's  why Reuben couldn't get in. So, Reuben, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna check this off for you, okay. Under the admin I'm gonna hit? Okay and I'm gonna say, okay and then I have to say,okay again.</p><br><p>And now, you should be able to get doggy passwords. So, it's  admin, doggy is your way to get in here. So, what we're gonna do up there we go. Reuben sees it. So, I'm gonna go over to my browser and we're going to monitor people's  progress here. So, we came over to the blank space there . Eight people in blank, okay check it out. So, we got W.J Warner. We got Richard Carlton. That's  me. That's  Margaret! That's  Michael, Scott Kane, using FileMaker cool cool cool Margaret's  on two machines. That machine market needs to be updated, that one's  out of date, whoops whoops, and then you got WebDirect over here. Which is Reuben, okay. And he's  in Denmark or Germany, keep forgetting. Where you're at you're over there somewhere Neverland. So, what's  up with Holland? So, he's  in Holland, okay, okay. So, that covers your FileMaker server. A little bit gives you an idea how to upload the files. If you try to access it with Pro or Go or WebDirect or something and the file is here yet you can. You can get at it with say Pro, but you can't get out with something else. It means you're extended. Privileges are messed up for that particular privilege set. So, notice over here, someone was asking, can an admin more than one admin log on everyone here has logged his admin? No one logged down on this is Fred. Margaret, can you log off and log back on as Fred for me? It'd be really swell when you open the launch or hold? If you want to do it with the launcher, hold the option. Well, you could do it over here. Do it with the launcher? Hold the option key down. Oh no, Fred is nevermind sorry Fred's  over here on this one. I think it's  Fred. I guess I could try it. I'm just trying to show you what that looks like. So,yep, another admin, it's  all admin.</p><br><p>We need someone who's  Fred. You see close open recently. I'm gonna hold the option key down right here to make sure it's  going to prompt me for credentials. So, another trick. If you save the credentials automatically and it keeps auto opening, if you don't want it to auto open with those credentials, hold down the option key on the Mac shift key on Windows. It will prompt you for the credentials and I'm going to say Fred. I think no password, you do not access. Oh, so, it let me in. But we don't have access privileges to perform this function. So, that was that I'm not allowed to use FileMaker Pro or Go. So, you have to turn that once again guaranteed test question right. So, I go back over here. I'm gonna have to log on. This is where you need more than one computer really is the easiest way someone's  gonna say we could have more than one copy of FileMaker on your computer. Just it's  where you do. Let me spend a moment here. So, when you're doing security, a big big tip, my personal gift from me to you have computer a have computer B in ideal world. Use one Mac, Computer, one Windows, Computer and the reason is that way you can see how things look. And you're looking for problems graphical anomalies where the alignment is a little bit off in the layout? It's  pretty close. But slightly off because of the font, rendering differences between the operating systems even between the Mac and iOs, which are both apple laterally, left and right. The spacing is correct, but when on iOs, it's  a little bit taller, like 10-15 percent taller. So, you get this left and right issue with Windows and Mac and then between Mac and iOs. You get this vertical height issue.</p><br><p>So, one computer here where you're logged in as the, let me go back over here. You're logged in as blank open recent we're gonna go blank. So, this computer here would be my administrative one and I'm gonna say doggy over here. I'm logged in over here and then what you do, I'm going to take my camera. So, no one freaks out. I'm going to go. Let me go full screen here just briefly here. So, I'm not trying not to make anyone sick. So, I'm going to move it very slowly. Computer one you're going to go here and do like administrative. Then you're going to come over here and test the credential and you're like it didn't work. Come back over here. Make a change to go back over here. It changes, tests change, test, change, test, change, chat, okay, got it that'll help everyone out, sorry you're getting ill. Super super super important for those of you who don't have haven't been down this road. You're kind of new to two computers doing serious development, super handy three computers, even better. But I'm not going to get excessively greedy. I have three here, but that's  because I can normally keep three busy. So, it is to fix this credential for Fred. We do have a question here. File manager file manage security. I have to go over here to get Fred's  using the read-only credential. So, I go to advanced settings right here and I say data entry only to notice that its access to FileMaker Pro is disabled. Once again, I told you it's  a test question. It's  coming for you, access via FileMaker Pro network means. FileMaker network means Pro and or Go both. So, if I turn this on right now and WebDirect for that matter. I guess and this is for this privilege set right the privilege set called date entry only. This is all grayed out, because you're not allowed to change this part of it. Okay and I hit okay. One more time, zoom out some more. So, we're not flailing around. Here I hit okay, I hit okay and now Fred you can log on as Fred and it'll work. Okay, there's  a question here. Admin has the same possibility, except if it's ios. So, I mentioned this briefly on the first day.</p><br><p>So, FileMaker Go, which is the iOs, iPhone, iPad, was created as a kind of bet between two Claris FileMaker. FileMaker engineers. At the time back in 2008, I think it was and basically said well, this is you know this iPhone. We've got as much power as a Mac lc, and it could run FileMaker whatever back in the day. So, it is so. We should be able to hack it and make it work, and so what they ended up doing is he took it and he removed the development features out of it. And left all the user access features in it and that's  how FileMaker Go is created. That's  also why there's  no Android version. Because if they could do that same kind of little jog, where you take your code and you tweak it. And you get an Android version, they would come out with. That would be the low-cost kind of cape. You know, low-class build and so, then, of course, Claris went on, went on the keynote that year and promised it in one year's  time.We promise we'll have this and it was a giant stress sandwich. I think they were all taking maalox down there because they weren't sure if Apple would approve it on the Apple store, etc, etc. And it was an interesting conversation. So, Apple ended up approving it. Apple uses it quite a bit themselves. So, it got very much approved but that's  what goku go came from the code base. The source code from Pro made Go, but they took out layout mode and managing scripts and all that kind of stuff. So, there we go. Is it just me or did someone just change my layout? What the hell? You did get everyone admin access. This is your captain speaking to the people who ripped out the middle seats of the 737 and playing twister on the floor. Would you kindly re-bolt the seats back to the floor of the airplane. So, other questions that we have? It's  getting a lot of work. I like an interactive crowd.</p><br><p>We've got a pretty big group of people here. People on youtube on zoom people, youtube, there's  a client how many clients are allowed in at the same time. Is there a limit to clients being on the server? That has always been the question. The answer is that you will run out of performance before you run out of restrictions on a client. So, let's talk. There's two answers here okay, two answers. Remember a little bit ago we talked about Claris wanting to charge you. So, let me go back over here to this. Okay, I'll make a visual here's  a visual visualization. So, this is an RCC site server. Part of our site license data API limit session limit. It doesn't really show a connection limit. I think it's unlimited. This one's  unlimited but a lot of times say that you buy for 10 users or 20 users. Then a lot of times what you'll see is a limit that you can have. So, many connections. Does that make sense? So, the idea is that the limit is either the limits or because you only bought. So, many one. If you have a site license then really they don't particularly care. But what they're going to do is they're going to look your company up on the internet and they're going to say. Oh, Michael Scott  at Caltrans has 8 500 people. So, they have to pay 8 500 times. Probably some ridiculously great deal like 20 dollars a person for the year. And then, they add all that up and it's  like 50-80. 100 000. They write checks to Claris and Claris gives them the software. So, there's  no one for those people. There wouldn't be restrictions. Most people have a restriction of 5 or 10 or 20, or something like that. That being said, if you have an unrestricted server like how far could this software really go. This  CRM software  that we're giving you but this software that we have this version is a Starting Point.</p><br> <p>We're going to talk about all the versions of Starting Point on I think Monday is the. Is this? The starter solution conversation is a little bit of this software right here. We have engineered it notwithstanding this opening video that was playing something else. We've had upwards of 300 people simultaneously connected using this file, okay. And it had millions of records. It does just fine with a good Amazon server. So, the more people you put on the server you need a bigger piece of hardware. That's  one cool thing about using virtual servers up on Amazon. Is that saying for a group of five or ten or twenty people might have this inexpensive server? That's  fifty dollars a month or eighty dollars a month or something like that. And then, if you put a hundred simultaneously on it, they're gonna go to a bigger server. Amazon has upwards of like 60, 50, 60 different sizes of servers. You can use it from my perspective. There's  probably eight or ten from low to stupidly. High we're talking a server, that's  200, a day kind of server, because it'll but it'll support. You know tons of people. So, if you need to have more than several hundred simultaneously in the file you need to test and make sure that your file will do that and it comes down to an issue of what will not So, much what FileMaker do. What does your solution do? In terms of calculations and things like that, for example, if I'm over here on an invoice  and I come down here to the bottom. When I displayed this invoice it fired calculations to update this information as we. What we do is we have a version of starting point?That's tuned a little better for more performances. It's  not this training version and we have it calculate this once. And then it doesn't calculate anymore. So, as you come to the screen all it has to do is retrieve the data from the hard drive of the server. And give you the data. It doesn't have to think about it.</p><br><p>All the fastest solution you can have in the world of FileMaker is one that just everything's  already calculated. And it's  already rendered. It just gives you the data where you have performance problems in FileMakers. Where you're going to bring back a million records and while you're at it give me an average deviation with a subtotal and this and that and a bunch of math on top of it. So, it has to bring up a million records and before it sends you the million records. It's got to think about it for 10 or 15 minutes or whatever it is. If you have a hundred people, then the calculations could be really small. But they're cumulative right like if I take a penny. I'll bring this out. It was an analogy from Mark. Richmond did a great job on analogy. He's  another FileMaker genius in the FileMaker business. He had a jar of pennies and liked it well. This jar of pennies is worthless. It's  like the little the minimum currency in the United States, the smallest stupid little currency thing. It's  a little copper coin thing. For those who have this United States, the United States. Then you have one or you have five they're, always in your pocket. You almost never throw them away. We try not to throw them away. You put them in a coin jar, but they're always everywhere. What are you gonna do with five of those? You can't even buy air for five cents. And so, what happens? Is though, that you put them in the jar and you put them in the jar and the jar starts getting full. And suddenly has several hundred us dollars in their pound sterling or whatever euros and suddenly says a big jar. It's  really heavy! That's  what every little calculation in there adds up to. So, suddenly, something that was lightweight a couple pennies here and there no one cares about. </p><br><p>But if you have two or three hundred people and they're each running little bits of calculations all over the place, suddenly, cumulatively, that big jar of pennies weighs a lot and that server is struggling. So, what are the things in terms of performance? We talk about in our performance section of our training. It's  our paid video course. I haven't talked about it a lot. These 30 days are not going to get you to become an expert. It's  going to get you to functional building a solution for your team is the goal. What is our goal? I'm not teaching you how to make it work with 500 people, okay. That's  a whole lot extra level of depth,okay. But, we cover that in our paid training course. So, for those of you wondering about this I know I'm just gonna do my obligatory promotion on that. If you go to FM  training, that tv is welcome to FMTraining.TV, that's  who we are here right. If you go to our bundles here, purchase the complete bundle. It's  all the training, it's  really quite good. It's  about 300 bucks for the year, maybe a little bit less. If you get a coupon code or something the point is that we're doing 30 hours here. There's  way over 100 hours of detailed training in there? So, we don't make that free. We do need to get paid for some of our work during the day, So, we have an entire section there on performance. We talk about that, but there, but theoretically you should. You can have hundreds and hundreds of users on a server. And if you need servers, hundreds here and 100 here and 100 in Europe and 100 Australia and maybe Asia, Pacific or something we have a way of setting up the servers. And having them talk to each other is called replication.</p><br><p>We spent five days of training on replication. We talked about that too. So, there's  answers for all these things. This is doing. FileMaker can be an entire career. It very easily can be an entire career and there's  a lot to learn. And not only once you learn it then you have to kind of keep relearning and refreshing and remembering what you've already forgotten. So, we had privilege. We talked about privilege sets. We talked about male privilege is essentially a role right. What does Sally do for the organization? What is her role? Okay, so, a role can be shared amongst people. So, you have a sales team. If you talk about sales, sales should be a privilege set, not an account. It should be Ken, Larry, Dick, Sally Smith, Fred, Wilma, Beverly. Those are all salespeople and they all have the salesperson privilege set. He actually called the salesperson right. You go. Let's  talk about that real quickly. Here file manage security, privilege sets down. Here you go to privilege sets, okay. You go to data entry only right data intro only you duplicate it, okay. edit it. So, now we can edit all this stuff. It's  called a sales team and what you do is the sales team starts off. As read read only or is it read only it's  reading right. Let's  see records edit, create edit delete in all tables right. So, then you could restrict it to certain tables right. You could say oh, they can only edit or delete or whatever in certain tables right certain layouts right. So, you duplicate it and create the customized setup. Hey, okay. Now you have a sales team over here. You say, okay, and then, as you create new users in the system. You got Ken and he gets the sales team right? Does it make sense? So, file manage security. I hit the wrong keyboard shortcut and you could duplicate it right. Then you could have Beverly right and she has her own password and she's  part of the sales team right. And then Juan, Juan, right? Has their password. He or she is right and so doing it. This way is the quick and easy way of doing it. </p><br><p>When you have 30 people on this list, it becomes kind of unwieldy somewhere between 20 and 40. It becomes a pain and that's  where you start thinking about using an external service to authenticate this part. Once the person authenticates they come in and then they basically are given a group or a privilege set. They're attached to a group or a privileged set. So, you could authenticate one externally and it comes back and says yeah, one's  part of sales just gives them the sales stuff perfectly right. Margaret, any other questions? We have. No, I think, we're good. Oh, wait. Oh, hold on. What if you share a file on iCloud and log in with two different users. For example, my Pro account and then my iCloud is not a server. Icloud is not a server and so a FileMaker server. So, it's  like saying you have a shared hard drive. You and Fred, like me and Margaret, are in dropbox. Together we both open the same file either won't either it won't let both of you in or it'll corrupt the file and damage the file. So, what FileMaker should do is say oh, someone else is opening this. You can't open. It is what it should do. If you both manage to open it, then probably you're going to corrupt the file. So, if you're trying to get out of this idea of paying Claris once again we're back to this conversation of how to get more free stuff. I mean basically Pro is going to be free. I'm giving you free training. Get a free  CRM.</p><br>What is FM Live Training?
